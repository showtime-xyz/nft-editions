# Zora NFT Editions // Showtime Fork

###

### What are these contracts?
1. `SingleEditionMintable`
   Each edition is a unique contract.
   This allows for easy royalty collection, clear ownership of the collection, and your own contract ðŸŽ‰
2. `SingleEditionMintableCreator`
   Gas-optimized factory contract allowing you to easily + for a low gas transaction create your own edition mintable contract.
3. `SharedNFTLogic`
   Contract that includes dynamic metadata generation for your editions removing the need for a centralized server.
   imageUrl and animationUrl can be base64-encoded data-uris for these contracts totally removing the need for IPFS

### How do I create a new contract?

### Directly on the blockchain:
1. Find/Deploy the `SingleEditionMintableCreator` contract
2. Call `createEdition` on the `SingleEditionMintableCreator`
